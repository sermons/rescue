## Why is **worship** worth it?
## 為何 **敬拜** 是值得的？

>>>
+ Worship is: **orienting** our hearts to face God
+ Focusing on **who** God is: **worthiness**, glory, grace
+ Reminding **self** of God's power + love
  + encouraging fellow **believers** stand firm in faith
  + bearing witness to **world**
+ The more we remember **truth** of who God is,
  + the more we are **transformed** into 
  + the **image** of God, from **glory** to glory.
+ Worship is **beholding** the Lamb
